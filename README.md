 
This GitHub repository contains an ASL (American Sign Language) recognition system. The project aims to develop a system that can recognize and classify different ASL signs using machine learning techniques.

### Main Function Points
- Develop a system to recognize and classify ASL signs
- Collect and preprocess data for training the machine learning model
- Implement a machine learning model to perform ASL sign recognition
- Test and evaluate the performance of the ASL recognition system

### Technology Stack
- Python programming language
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn)
- Computer vision techniques (e.g., image processing, feature extraction)

### License
The project is licensed under the MIT license, which is a permissive open-source license that allows for commercial use, modification, and distribution of the software.
